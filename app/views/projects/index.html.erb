Often choosing a good data structure for your needs is very difficult, and many times it is made even more difficult when you do not know what the particular needs of your data structure are until it is already out in the wild. Smart Data Structure is a python tool that solves this problem. At compile-time, it looks at your code and predicts what data structure is most appropriate, then at run-time it constantly reevaluates its decision. If it finds that another data structure is better, it will swap out the data structures in real time. Now students don't have to worry about remembering when to use a Red-Black Tree or a Heap because they can just use Smart Data Structure. Building this tool was really fun because I got to directly apply what I had learned in class to an application that I will use in the future. Plus it was great studying for the final!"; %>
